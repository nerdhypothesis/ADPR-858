            <h2>The Missing Native American Boys of Nebraska</h2>
            <h4>For every Native American girl missing in Nebraska, two Native boys are missing.</h4>
            <p>Last year, when 22-year-old Gabby Petito’s missing and murder case was making whirlwinds, some activists questioned the silence on missing and murdered Native American women. 

                But missingness may not only be predominant among the Native American girls and women; perhaps the most vulnerable group is teenage boys.
                
                More than two-thirds of missing Native Americans in Nebraska are boys under the age of 17 years as per a study. Dr. Tara Richards and Dr. Emily Wright, criminology and criminal justice faculty members University of Nebraska Omaha conducted the study in association with Nebraska State Patrol.
                
                The findings from the study further showed missing Native American boys in Nebraska are outpacing the missing person rate for White people and other races and are second only to Black people. 
                
                The data also showed that several of the Native American boys who returned are going missing repeatedly at a higher rate (9.6%) than the state average (2.9 %).
                
                A large section of the children was also found to be missing from out-of-home care placement.</p>
