        <h4>For every Native American girl missing in Nebraska, two Native boys are missing.</h4>
            
        <p>More than two-thirds of missing Native Americans in Nebraska are boys under the age of 17 years as per a study by researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha.</p>

        <p>The findings from the study further showed missing Native American boys in Nebraska are outpacing the missing person rate for White people and other races and are second only to Black people.</p>
            
        <p>Nebraska Foster Care Review office observed a high prevalence of mental health challenges and substance use among the children that were further aggravated due to domestic violence, poverty and lack of affordable housing/homelessness.</p>

        <p>Ty Rushing is probably one of the few journalists who chose to return to journalism despite the newsroom shrinkage. The young journalist left the plush corporate job for a new journalism model that offered him a competitive pay. But for Rushing the game changer was the mission.</p>
