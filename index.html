                    <h2>The Missing Native American Boys of Nebraska</h2>
                    <h4>For every Native American girl missing in Nebraska, two Native boys are missing.</h4>
                    <p>Last year, when 22-year-old Gabby Petito’s missing and murder case was making whirlwinds, some activists questioned the silence on missing and murdered Native American women. 

                        But missingness may not only be predominant among the Native American girls and women; perhaps the most vulnerable group is teenage boys.
                        
                        More than two-thirds of missing Native Americans in Nebraska are boys under the age of 17 years as per a study. Dr. Tara Richards and Dr. Emily Wright, criminology and criminal justice faculty members University of Nebraska Omaha conducted the study in association with Nebraska State Patrol.
                        
                        The findings from the study further showed missing Native American boys in Nebraska are outpacing the missing person rate for White people and other races and are second only to Black people. 
                        
                        The data also showed that several of the Native American boys who returned are going missing repeatedly at a higher rate (9.6%) than the state average (2.9 %).
                        
                        A large section of the children was also found to be missing from out-of-home care placement.</p>

                                    A century back jobs at the railroads and meatpacking industries had made the neighborhoods in North Omaha bustling with Black migrants from the South.

            <h2>Why This Journalist Returned To Newsroom During Mass Exodus</h2>
            <p>Ty Rushing is probably one of the few journalists who chose to return to the profession after leaving for greener pastures in the corporate world. 

                Rushing chose the career despite the shrinkage in newsrooms and worked his way up. As Rushing was dealing with the challenges of low wages, industry uncertainties and burnout, similar to his peers, he joined the corporate sector. But there was a U-turn waiting for Rushing.
                
                Soon, he was approached by Iowa Starting Line, a new journalism model with a pay competitive to corporate wages. But there were another game changer — the mission.</p>

                        <p>Like many Native communities, housing is a critical priority for the Winnebago Tribe, residing in rural northeast Nebraska. 

                            Programs and partnerships across the community are helping more tribal members realize the dream of home ownership, a first in the history of many families. The Housing Program includes Down Payment Assistance for its members to construct homes on the reservation.</p>
