        <h4>For every Native American girl missing in Nebraska, two Native boys are missing.</h4>
            
        <p>More than two-thirds of missing Native Americans in Nebraska are boys under the age of 17 years as per a study by researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tara Richards and Dr. Emily Wright, criminology and criminal justice faculty members at UNO conducted the study in association with Nebraska State Patrol.</p>

        <p>The findings from the study further showed missing Native American boys in Nebraska are outpacing the missing person rate for White people and other races and are second only to Black people.</p>
            
        <p>Nebraska Foster Care Review office further observed a high prevalence of mental health challenges and substance use among the children. The other reasons were domestic violence, poverty and lack of affordable housing/homelessness.</p>
