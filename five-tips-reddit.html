            <h1>5 Tips for Journalists to Use Reddit for News Sourcing</h1>
            <p>Thinking about audience engagement or promoting your stories on the social?</p>
            <p>A BusinessWire survey reports Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook as the top platform choices where journalists prefer to share their stories.</p>
            <h4>But if you are looking for sourcing new story ideas, finding sources and tracking news trends you may like to explore Reddit.</h4>  
            <p>Here are five tips to use Reddit for effective news sourcing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <p>1. Are you looking for stories on subreddits or Reddit communities? Try the ones with smaller names. For example, if you like to report on technology-oriented stories, r/technology will give you access to posts from 11.4 million members whereas r/technology_reviews would offer access to posts of only 2500 members.</p>
            <p>2. If you are searching Reddit for a topic you are reporting on, you might think of searching subreddits. But wait, the Annenberg Media Center of the University of Southern California has a different recommendation. They suggest searching with keywords instead of searching subreddits as the latter might have a high volume of posts but many of them would be memes or content which are irrelevant.</p>
            <p>3. You might be searching your Reddit content by the default options of the newest, the most controversial or the hottest. But have you considered sorting the content using the top option? The top option will allow you to sort the best of the content for different ranges of time such as hour, week, month or best ever.</p>
            <p>4. If you are doing a story and seeking information in real-time you may find Reddit Stream useful. It will show you comments on the selected topic as soon as they are posted and in chronological order.</p>
            <p>5. If you want more from your free Reddit account, try the Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) that will give you access to some features of Reddit Gold. With RES you can log in from multiple accounts, scroll endlessly the front page, have an in-line image view and much more.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>If you are still wondering why to try another social media, Reddit brings you 430 million monthly active users and over 100,000 active communities. Besides Reddit posts and comments are upvoted and downvoted by users, so unlike social trends, such content is significantly more relevant and has higher engagement.</p>
