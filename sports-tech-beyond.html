            <h3>Chevelle Saunsoci is a Division I basketball player and coached several university teams for NCAA tournaments. She founded DVLP, a sports and athletic training startup, is one of the success stories in Nebraska’s small business sector.</h3>
            <p>Nebraska is among the few northern states that have witnessed the astounding success of black women-owned businesses.</p>
            <p>While greater success is seen in the southern states, Nebraska ranks among the Top 20 in the latest study by Merchant Maverick. Omaha alone has several hundred small businesses owned by black people in diverse domains. How has it been for these entrepreneurs since 2020?</p>

            <p>In 2021, Harvard Business Review conducted a study to explore the entrepreneurial culture among black women. The data revealed 17% are in the process of starting or managing startups, with 61% self-funding their start-up capital and 3% running mature businesses. These women are gradually forging a path into the mainstream economy, mostly as small business owners.</p>
            <p>Forbes magazine reported black women entrepreneurs raised $494 million in the first half of 2021, almost doubling the funding raised in the entire year of 2020. There's a concurring voice from DVLP in Omaha, led by former basketball player Chevelle Saunsoci.</p>
            <p>DVLP, a sports and athletic training startup, is one of the success stories in Nebraska's small business sector. The founder, popularly known as Coach Chevy, was a Division I basketball player and coached several university teams for NCAA tournaments. She trains young players who aim to achieve higher levels in professional sports through on-field training, recruiting, advising and video guidance.</p>
            <p>"We have done camps and training for youth teams as large as 200. As I aimed to build relationships through interactions and inspire young talents, I wanted to do something beyond college coaching, focusing more on the high school level."</p>
