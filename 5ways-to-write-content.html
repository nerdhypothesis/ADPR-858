            <h3>Five to fifteen seconds — that is all you have got to catch an online reader’s eyes before they scroll to the next post.</h3>
            <h3>Here are five things I have curated from experts and award winning writers that you can try to keep your readers engaged.</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>1. The Title – The Key To Your Reader’s Eyes</h3>
            <p>Titles can make your content draw attention from busy millions in a second. While click-bait titles have a downside, companies like Upworthy encourage writing 25 headlines for each post and testing the top choices on social media. Rob Munday, Managing Editor at Short of the Week, recommends creating titles that are clear, concise, specific to the topic, and work out of context.</p>
            <h3>2. The Lead – The Key To Your Reader’s Mind</h3>
            <p>Pulitzer winner John McPhee called the lead a promise that tells the readers about the piece. Many prefer the inverted pyramid style of straight news lead that requires putting upfront key elements of the story — who, what, when, where, and why. However, there are other popular forms of lead — anecdotal or scene-setting, observational or first-person experience, or even a Zinger.</p>
            <h3>3. Help Your Readers Scan</h3>
            <p>You already know your readers don’t read entire sentences. So make scanning easy and guide them through your story with simple sentences, commonly used language, short paragraphs, highlighting information as headings, subheadings, block quotes, italics & bold formats. Present your content for the readers to visualize through scene-setting, images, videos, infographics, and hyperlinked content for those who want more information or the source story.</p>
            <h3>4. Talk to Your Readers, Show Your Story</h3>
            <p>We love social media because there, people talk to us through written words but in personal style, something we can visualize. Use a conversational tone and active voice to talk to your readers and help them see and interact with your point.</p>
            <h3>5. Writing for Search Engine Optimization</h3>
            <p>If your stories are reaching your readers online, what could you be doing right? Maybe you are using the right set of keywords in your headline, body content, and page-link, that your readers are searching. Dive deeper into SEO techniques but be careful of random use keywords and tags or click baits.</p>
