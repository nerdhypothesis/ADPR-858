            <h1>The Missing Native American Boys of Nebraska</h1> 
            <h3>For every Native American girl missing in Nebraska, two Native boys are missing.</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Last year, when 22-year-old Gabby Petito’s missing and murder case was making whirlwinds, some activists questioned the silence on missing and murdered Native American women.</p>
            <p>But missingness may not only be predominant among the Native American girls and women; perhaps the most vulnerable group is teenage boys.</p>
            <h4>A recent study confirms more than two-thirds of missing Native Americans in Nebraska are boys under the age of 17 years.</h4>
            <p>The study was conducted by Dr. Tara Richards and Dr. Emily Wright, criminology and criminal justice faculty members University of Nebraska Omaha conducted the study in association with Nebraska State Patrol.</p>

            <h4>“If you look at the missing persons’ Task Force reports for native women, children and relatives from New Mexico and Arizona they also found that most missing Native American persons were men and boys,” — TARA RICHARDS</h4> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-span-6">

        </div>
        <div class="col-span-6">
            <p>The findings from the study further showed missing Native American boys in Nebraska are outpacing the missing person rate for White people and other races. They are second only to Black people.</p>
            <p>While White boys disappear at the rate of 0.8 times of the White population, for Native American boys the rate is 3.1 times of their population in the state.</p>
            <p>The data also showed that several of the Native American boys who returned are going missing repeatedly at a higher rate (9.6%) than the state average (2.9 %).</p>
            <p>Five broad reasons were identified for this high rate of missingness — domestic violence, mental health challenges, substance use, poverty, lack of affordable housing/homelessness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-span-6">
            <p>A large section of the children was also found to be missing from out-of-home care placement. 
            <p>“They may try to unite with their families, community or sibling in a foster care,” said Richards. “They could have moved families and schools a lot, so they don’t have strong bonds to their schools or their communities."</p>
            <p>Nebraska Foster Care Review office, which was associated with Richards, observed a high prevalence of mental health challenges and substance use among the children.</p>
            <h4>“Their living situation is very dynamic and unstable. If they go missing it disrupts their behavior and substance use care.” — TARA RICHARDS</h4>

        </div>
        <div class="col-span-6">
            <p>Another challenge associated with the missingness is delay or not reporting the missing cases.</p>
            <p>Wright observed a sense of fear and negative perception persisting among the families toward law enforcement and child welfare services.</p>
            <p>The researchers proposed recommendations involving community education and outreach, better engagement between the communities, law enforcement and child welfare, increase in diversity of the state patrol staff, addressing mental health needs of the children.</p>

        <div class="col-span-6">
            <p>The missing Native American girls caught public attention only in recent years, spiraling out of grassroots movements. However, the issue of missing boys continues to remain a silent story.Activists and experts believe more visibility of the issue is needed.</p>
            <p>Colette Yellow Robe, a Native American activist, academic and mother of two boys, advocated the need to build a public discourse around the issue. She also emphasized creating an open home environment as did she for her sons.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Sen. Tom Brewer sponsored LB 154 to commission a study to “determine the scope of the problem, identify barriers, and find ways to create partnerships to increase reporting and investigation of missing Native American women.”</p>
            <p>The state-wide study conducted by the UNO faculty members resulted from this initiative throwing light on boys missing at a disproportionate rate. The researchers called for expanding the vision toward a more holistic scope.</p>
