            <p>Annette Hamilton, Vice President, and Chief Operating Officer, Ho-Chunk, Inc. shares the story of the economic development of the Winnebago Tribe in Nebraska and her own story of becoming a self-made Cinderella.</p>
            <p>In the early-mid 1990s, the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska was exploring social entrepreneurship models for job creation and long-term economic self-sufficiency. At the time, poverty and its symptoms were painfully visible in the community. Tribal leaders knew the expansion of casino gaming in Iowa would threaten the Tribe's modest revenue from its small casino on the reservation near Sloan, Iowa. The tribe needed to diversify its revenue and lessen its reliance on meager federal government funding to help its people in significant ways.</p>

            <p>Annette talks about the role of a Native American tribal development company which is different from other corporations because success is defined by its ability to effect change for the tribal community.</p>
            <p>"Culture and history are inseparable from the company, including healing from historical trauma. Centuries of oppression have threatened the traditional way of life and identity of Native Americans â€“ including the Winnebago people. Those deep scars are felt today," she says.</p>
            <p>The tribe realized simply, creating jobs wasn't enough, their approach had to evolve. "There's a motto that's frequently said in our company, to do one thing, you must do everything."</p>
            <p>This led to the foundation of Ho-Chunk, Inc. or "The People, Incorporated", an award-winning socio-economic development corporation. With its mission to enable the Winnebago Tribe to reach economic self-sufficiency, it honors the vision of Reuben Snake and other historical tribal leaders by connecting the past to a brighter future. The company's profits and leadership help facilitate social and economic advancement through housing, jobs and educational programs, community partnerships, and non-profit and cultural donations.</p>
            <p>Annette talks about the five shared priorities of the Winnebago Tribe which are aimed through Ho-Chunk, Inc.: Youth, education, housing, employment, and elders.</p>
