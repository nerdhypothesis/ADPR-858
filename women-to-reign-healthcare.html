            <p>Women set to rule the healthcare industry with a diversity of portfolios and equity in leadership at its heart.</p>
            <p>The Women in Workplace 2019 report cited healthcare as one of the best industries for women, who make up more than 50% of the workforce. So if you are looking for diversity, equity, and inclusivity, is healthcare the undisputed champion?</p>
            <p>A 2020 report by the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) suggests it is the case in the state. Out of the 18 health and allied professions listed by UNMC in 2020, women constituted more than half of the workforce in 12 of them, including five with over 90% majority. The report recorded steady growth since 2007. So what set the pace for this transformation?</p>

            <p>Dr. Kirti Gupta a practitioner of Internal Medicine and a board member at CHI Health, Omaha talks about how women medical practitioners in decision-making roles sparked the change.</p>
            <p>Women's presence as nurses and assistants has been historically predominant in the delivery of healthcare at the bedside. But as the number of women graduates soared at medical schools, surpassing men, Kirti calls it new dawn in the healthcare sector.</p>
            <p>Quite similar to her career path, these women graduates are instrumental in making healthcare management and policy development to be more equitable and diverse.</p>

        <div class="col-span-8">
            <p>"I was trained to be a clinician but I sought avenues to take part in governance and finance of the healthcare operations. As my interests grew in managerial decision-making, I joined the Board of CHI Health to help shape the trajectory of its growth and guide the policy-making process," Kirti says, reflecting back on her journey from the mid-90s when she entered medical school at Creighton.</p>
            <p>She asserts that as more women doctors are making bedside decisions, there is a natural tendency towards wanting to improve all the professional aspects at a much larger scale.</p>
            <p>The traditional role of women as primary caregivers is expanding from the hospital or home personal care towards ancillary services. </p>
