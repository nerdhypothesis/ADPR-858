            <p> Ty Rushing is probably one of the few journalists who chose to return to the profession after leaving for greener pastures in the corporate world.</p>
            <p>Kansas boy Rushing started young in the newsroom of the University of Missouri Kansas City. “English was my jam and journalism my love,” he recalls.</p>
            <p>Rushing chose the career despite the shrinkage in newsrooms and worked his way up. From being a student journalist to becoming the managing editor at N’West Iowa Review, he had a modest run for almost a decade.</p>
            <p>But 2020 was a strong nail in the careers of many journalists. Like his peers, Rushing was dealing with the challenges of low wages, industry uncertainties and burnout due to targets of delivering more than journalism. </p>

            <p>Michelle Kuester, a former journalist and a former colleague of Rushing chose to exit her journalism career a few years back for a more stable corporate career. “As I grew older and began to crave a regular schedule, a transition into corporate communications felt natural as I attained much of the experience needed for that role while working in journalism” she said.</p>
            <p>Like Michelle, Rushing found his perfect escape in the corporate world. He joined Ho-Chunk Inc. in January 2021. But there was a U-turn waiting for Rushing. Soon, he was approached by Iowa Starting Line, a new journalism model with a pay competitive to corporate wages. But there were another game changer — the mission</p>

        <div class="col-span-6">
            <p>Rushing, who was looking for a work-life balance with decent pay, calls it “wild for journalism in the Midwest.”</p>
            <p>At Iowa Starting Line, Rushing is now working towards developing the team and measurable impact factors to counter online disinformation while achieving high audience engagement on Facebook. He constantly works on audience research, multimedia stories and even light-hearted posts that he calls “candy.”</p>
            <p>“The sugar is writing about weird food and drinks,” he said. “But the vegetables are going to be there, like the legislative session or reporting the impact of federal policies and federal dollar expenditure.” </p>

        <div>
            <p>Nicole Wiegand, a former colleague at N’West Iowa Review, talks about Rushing’s style of putting his persona in his news posts.</p>
            <p>“Really important and interesting discourse happens in Ty’s Twitter mentions,” she said. “I feel like I’m getting my news from an old friend. I know he’s a trusted source when it comes to getting to the bottom of a story."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-span-6">
            <p>Rushing is still adapting to this form of journalism and figuring out what motivates the audience. But he is hopeful that these new models are the future of journalism.</p>
            <p>“The independent news sector is growing,” he said. “People will need news, hence they would need us, the watchdogs.”</p>
