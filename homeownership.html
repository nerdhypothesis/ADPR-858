        <p>A homeownership program is changing the landscape and lives of the Winnebago Indian tribe in rural northeast Nebraska. Ho-Chunk Inc., the economic development corporation of the Winnebago tribe has increased housing units manifolds in recent years. The residents are not only realizing their dream of homeownership, but for many, it is a first in the history of many of their families.</p>

        <p>Homeownership has been out of reach for many Native Americans living on the tribal lands. Tribal laws in addition to lack of access to mortgages, limited infrastructure, and low rural valuations have been constant barriers. This forces the tribal members to continue to live in crowded, low-income housing or move out of the reservations. At Winnebago, it was no different, especially with a population growth of 30 percent in the last seven years.</p>
        
        <p>Their call was answered by Ho-Chunk as the company adopted an innovative approach by leveraging programs, partnerships, and funding sources. With over 150* custom-built homes, the Ho-Chunk Village offers living conditions that were unimaginable even ten years back.</p>

        <p>Jaime Monroe became the owner of a custom-designed townhouse at the Ho-Chunk Village about five years back. She recalls the desolate town as seen in her childhood. “You had to be on a waitlist even to get a low-cost two-bedroom housing and ended up living away from the community. Becoming a homeowner right in our mid-twenties, was an unattainable dream, even a few years back.”</p>

        <p>The scope of Ho-Chunk’s homeownership program is however beyond infrastructural development. As the company ensured the financial success of the tribal members through job creation, it led to their leaving the tribal lands due to a lack of housing and their non-eligibility for the low-income federal housing program.</p>

        <p>Lance Morgan, CEO of Ho-Chunk Inc. says, “Tribal members have been graduating from college and entering professional careers more than ever. That lead to an exodus of the emerging middle class because most housing on the reservation was low income and overcrowded. Too often, people were also leaving the problems of a poorer community. Our approach had to change to facilitate all levels of homeownership."</p>

        <p>To achieve the vision, the Housing program included a Down Payment Assistance of up to $75000 per family, and a home buyer education program. These programs help first-time homebuyers be aware of responsibilities such as maintenance and financial liabilities while facilitating them with a one-time grant to ease mortgage issues. To date $ 3.27 million has been awarded to more than 70 tribal members with 19 others in the pipeline and awaiting approval.</p>

        <p>Jaralyn Bear who became a homeowner in the Ho-Chunk Village talks about how it provides a sense of home and belonging, of safety and security, to her young family. “Without the forgivable loan from the Down Payment Assistance Program we would still be at my parents’ house, or we wouldn’t live in Winnebago.”</p>

        <p>The at-cost housing plan significantly lowers the ownership barrier. A townhouse home that costs about $ 250,000 in Sioux City, Iowa would cost nearly $100,000 less in the Ho-Chunk village. As more than 300 people are on a waitlist for a home in the Ho-Chunk Village, a further plan is underway to build 280+ housing units.</p>

        <p>Not only housing but a 40-acre block has also been developed keeping in mind a healthy lifestyle and community needs. It includes indoor and outdoor playgrounds, walking trails connected with parks, a farmers market, a sculpture garden, a coffee shop and restaurant, general stores, business offices, and other commercial buildings.</p>

        <p>As Monroe raises her two daughters in her Winnebago townhouse, she remarks on how it has changed the attitude of her children. “My children and the younger generation would not live in the hardships that our generation witnessed. For them, this improved quality of life will be the norm.”</p>
